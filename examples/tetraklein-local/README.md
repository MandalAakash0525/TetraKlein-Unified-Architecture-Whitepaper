\\# TetraKlein Local Validation Suite







Status: Validation Test



Audience: Technical auditors, external reviewers



Scope: Computational feasibility and cryptographic soundness checks



Not a production system







\\### Purpose of This Test Suite







This contains a local, reproducible validation suite for the TetraKlein execution and proof model.



The goal is not to demonstrate a complete system or a deployable product.



This validation does not attempt to model malicious provers, adaptive adversaries, or cryptographic side-channel attacks.







\\### The goal is to answer a narrower and critical question:







Can the proposed execution, proof, and aggregation model actually run on real hardware under conservative assumptions?







This suite provides evidence that it can.







\\### What This Validation Demonstrates







This validation demonstrates:







Deterministic execution trace generation







STARK-compatible Algebraic Intermediate Representation (AIR) constraints







The validation assumes a standard FRI-based STARK soundness model with conservative parameter bounds; no novel soundness claims are made.



FRI domain sizing and blow-up feasibility







FRI query soundness versus verifier cost







Incremental Verifiable Computation (IVC) recursion bounds







IVC is used here in the generic sense of recursive proof aggregation, not as a claim of compatibility with any specific named IVC construction







Prover throughput and energy feasibility on consumer GPUs







Epoch-based aggregation suitable for real-time workloads







All tests are executed on standard consumer hardware with no specialized accelerators.







\\### What This Validation Does Not Claim







This does not claim:







Production readiness







Regulatory or medical approval







Completeness of the full TetraKlein system







Optimized performance ceilings







Security against all adversarial models







Hardware independence







It establishes feasibility, not deployment.

\\### Final Statement







Known Limitations







Single-node only







No network latency modeling







No adversarial prover simulation







No production cryptographic hardening

Nothing relies on assumption alone.







------------------------------------



\### Deep Audit tklocal\_deep\_audit.py



1\. How to run the Deep Feasibility Audit

Prerequisites



You need a standard scientific Python environment. No proprietary tools are required.



Minimum requirements



Python ≥ 3.10 (tested on 3.12)



A functioning CUDA stack is not required for this audit (unlike the prover tests)



CPU-only execution is sufficient



Required Python packages



pip install numpy sympy mpmath psutil matplotlib qutip



Running the audit



From the repository root:



python tests/tklocal\_deep\_audit.py





That is it.



There are no flags, no parameters, and no hidden state.



Where the results go



All output is written to a dedicated audit log directory, separate from the other validation tests:



logs/

└── deep\_audit/

&nbsp;   ├── console.log        # stdout / stderr (full trace)

&nbsp;   ├── deep\_audit.log     # structured audit log

&nbsp;   └── spectral\_gap.png   # generated plot





You should never rely on terminal output.

The logs are the authoritative record.



2\. What the audit actually does (goal by goal)



The audit is not a benchmark and not a security proof.

It is a structural and mathematical feasibility audit.



Each “Goal” checks a different failure mode that would invalidate the architecture if it failed.



Goal 1 — Contractivity \& Convergence



What it checks



Symbolic convergence of recursive update rules



Whether error terms converge or diverge



What the log means



Limit(error\_t) = sigma / (1 - rho), for rho < 1





This proves that:



Recursive execution remains bounded



No hidden exponential divergence exists



If this failed

Recursive aggregation would be mathematically unsound.



Goal 2 — Hypercube Spectral Gap



What it checks



Exact eigenstructure of the N-dimensional hypercube graph



Mixing and convergence behavior of routing / ledger topology



Why this matters

The hypercube is used as a communication and aggregation substrate.

If its spectral gap collapsed, gossip and consensus would become unstable.



What the log means



N=8, spectral\_gap=2, normalized\_gap=0.2500





This confirms:



The spectral gap is exactly as expected



It scales smoothly as 

2

/

𝑁

2/N



No pathological eigenvalue behavior appears



The file spectral\_gap.png



Visual confirmation of expected 

2

/

𝑁

2/N decay



Useful for reviewers to sanity-check assumptions



Goal 3 — Quantum-Thermodynamic Proxy



What it checks



Numerical stability under dissipative dynamics



Absence of chaotic energy growth



Important disclaimer

This is not a physical thermodynamic simulation.

It is a minimal Lindblad proxy used to detect numerical instability.



What the log means



Max energy drift = 2.0201e-02





This shows:



Energy remains bounded



Noise does not induce runaway behavior



The numerical layer is stable enough for XR/physics integration



Goal 4 — AIR / IVC Polynomial Degree Safety



What it checks



That AIR constraints remain within low polynomial degree



That verifier challenges do not inflate trace degree



Why this is critical

STARK systems fail outright if constraint degrees grow accidentally.



What the log means



AIR degree (trace vars only) = 2





This confirms:



The execution model is compatible with STARK-style proof systems



Recursive composition does not violate algebraic constraints



Goal 5 — Post-Quantum Security Sanity (Illustrative)



What it checks



That parameter choices are not obviously broken



That claimed security margins are not fantasy



What it is NOT



Not a security proof



Not a claim of equivalence to NIST schemes



What the log means



Estimated BKZ cost ≈ 2^224.3 (classical)

Extractor statistical distance ≤ 2^-384





This shows:



Conservative margins beyond 192-bit classical



Extractor leakage is negligible



If this failed, the system would be cryptographically implausible.



Goal 6 — XR / Physics Constraint Closure



What it checks



That XR physics constraints close algebraically



That squaring constraints does not exceed AIR limits



What the log means



Rigid-body constraint degree = 4

Quaternion constraint degree = 4

XR physics constraints closed under AIR bounds





This confirms:



XR pose and orientation constraints can be proven



No hidden verifier blow-ups exist



Physics constraints are compatible with zero-knowledge verification



3\. What this audit really proves (and what it does not)

What it proves



This audit demonstrates that:



The TetraKlein execution model is internally consistent



All algebraic constraints remain within STARK-compatible bounds



Recursive aggregation is stable and bounded



Numerical and graph-theoretic assumptions hold



No hidden mathematical or computational impossibility exists



In plain language:



Nothing fundamental breaks when you try to run this architecture on real hardware under conservative assumptions.



That is a strong feasibility result.



What it explicitly does NOT prove



This audit does not claim:



Production readiness



Adversarial security



Side-channel resistance



Network-level correctness



Regulatory or safety approval



Those would require entirely different analyses.



4\. How an external reviewer should read the logs



A reviewer should:



Open logs/deep\_audit/deep\_audit.log



Confirm:



All goals appear in order



All conclude without exceptions



Optionally inspect:



spectral\_gap.png



Confirm there are no silent skips or warnings



If the final line appears:



=== TetraKlein Deep Feasibility Audit COMPLETE ===





Then the audit passed in full.



Final takeaway



This audit proves that the TetraKlein execution and proof architecture is mathematically coherent, algebraically compatible with STARK-style systems, and computationally feasible on real hardware—without claiming security or deployment readiness.
