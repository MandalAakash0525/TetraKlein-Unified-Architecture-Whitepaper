## Overview

**TetraKlein** is a unified computational, cryptographic, and extended-reality (XR) architecture developed by **Baramay Station Research Inc.**, a Canadian non-profit research organization.  
This repository publishes the mathematical framework, AIR constraint system, XR physics formulations, digital-twin convergence rules, and verification pipeline defining the TetraKlein system.

TetraKlein integrates:

- Post-quantum cryptography (Kyber, Dilithium, Module-LWE/SIS)  
- Zero-knowledge proof systems (AIR, STARKs, IVC, folding, FRI)  
- Verifiable compute engines (SP1, RISC Zero, Brevis, zkSync-derived provers)  
- XR physics and rendering pipelines (TK-U, XR-TSU kernels, foveation models)  
- Digital-Twin Convergence (DTC lineage, projection operators)  
- Hypercube ledger topology (HBB, Recursive Tesseract Hashing)  
- IPv6-native mesh identity and routing (Yggdrasil, PQC-authenticated overlays)  
- Cross-layer AIR constraints enabling recursive multi-domain verification

This repository is intended for researchers, engineers, cryptographers, XR developers, and academic institutions looking to analyze, extend, or experimentally validate a unified verifiable-compute architecture.

### Research-Stage Disclaimer

The current version of the TetraKlein architecture is an early-stage,
research-oriented framework. It is **not** a production system and **makes
no claims of operational readiness**, security guarantees, clinical or
industrial safety, or real-world deployment feasibility. All mathematical
models, AIR constraints, XR physics bindings, digital-twin operators, and
ledger constructs are subject to heavy scrutiny, independent validation,
and long-term peer review. The material in this repository should be
treated strictly as a **research roadmap**—a foundation for future work
that will require extensive testing, reproducibility studies, formal
verification, adversarial analysis, and multi-year refinement by the
broader scientific and engineering community before any practical use is
considered.

## Limitations 

TetraKlein is a research-stage architecture that integrates post-quantum cryptography, zero-knowledge verification, extended-reality physics, and digital-twin synchronization. While the present public edition consolidates a large body of mathematical and architectural work, the system remains non-operational, unverified, and unsuitable for deployment in any safety-critical, commercial, clinical, or industrial environment.

The following limitations apply:

No Operational Guarantees
The framework has not undergone formal security audits, adversarial testing, implementation verification, or multi-party reproducibility studies.
No component—PQC identity, TK–VM execution, AIR constraints, XR physics, DTC convergence, or HBB ledger logic—should be treated as production-grade.

Potential for Mathematical Incompleteness
Some constructions (e.g., rotation-closure constants, TSU coupling operators, hypercube spectral operators) may require refinement or replacement as formal proofs mature.
Certain equations, invariants, or AIR relations may be incomplete or require stronger boundary conditions.

Simulation and XR Models Are Not Calibrated
XR physics kernels, TSU-style operators, and Digital Twin Convergence rules have not been experimentally validated.
They serve as theoretical models, not as real-world physical simulations.

No Autonomous System Claims
TetraKlein provides no autonomy algorithms.
Any future use of the architecture for control or decision-making requires Cognitive Proof Layer (CPL) verification and independent safety reviews.
No autonomous behavior is implied or supported in this edition.

No Medical, Clinical, or Physiological Application
The system must not be used for any diagnostic, therapeutic, clinical, or physiological context.
Non-invasive BCI references are strictly limited to voluntary, external sensing and do not imply medical use.

Hardware Assumptions May Not Hold
Raspberry Pi nodes, NPU accelerators, GPUs, and other hardware referenced here are illustrative.
Real-world performance, thermal stability, networking behavior, and security properties remain untested.

Security Assumptions Are Unproven in Practice
Although based on well-studied cryptographic primitives, no end-to-end implementation of TetraKlein currently exists.
PQC lifecycles, STARK recursion, IVC folding schedules, and RTH lineage commitments have not been validated in a unified system.

Risk of Misinterpretation
Early versions of the TetraKlein paper included speculative concepts.
While this edition removes speculative framing, historical material remains for archival accuracy and must not be construed as evidence of functionality.

Requires Multi-Year Scrutiny
Any future development of TetraKlein will require long-term evaluation by cryptographers, distributed-systems engineers, XR researchers, and formal methods specialists.

## Summary Statement

TetraKlein should be regarded as a research roadmap, not an implementation specification.
No claims are made regarding operability, safety, correctness, or deployability.
All components require substantial future validation, formal verification, and independent peer review before use outside controlled research environments.

## Risks and Misuse Prevention

TetraKlein is an experimental research architecture.
Although the framework is intended for open scientific exploration, several forms of misuse could create risks to users, developers, and the public. This section defines the boundaries, prohibited uses, and responsible-development constraints that apply to all current and future work associated with the system.

1. Misinterpretation as Operational Technology

TetraKlein is not a deployable XR system, cryptographic protocol, distributed ledger, or control stack.
Premature use in production, infrastructure, or safety-critical contexts poses serious risks:

undefined security properties, untested XR physics and latency behavior, invalid convergence guarantees, unproven cryptographic lifecycle assumptions.
The system must not be integrated into real-world identity, ledger, industrial, or safety systems.

2. Misuse in Automated or Autonomous Decision Systems

TetraKlein does not provide autonomous agent behavior or decision-making logic.
Any attempt to use the architecture for automated control systems—robots, drones, vehicles, manufacturing systems, finance algorithms, or defense applications—would violate the intent of this research and create unacceptable hazards.

Only non-autonomous, human-supervised experimentation is permitted.
All future autonomy research must pass through Cognitive Proof Layer (CPL) verifiability and independent safety review.

3. Misuse in Medical, Clinical, or Physiological Contexts

TetraKlein is not a medical device and must not be used for any diagnostic, therapeutic, surgical, or monitoring purpose.
No support for medical BCI. No interpretation of physiological signals. No diagnostic or therapeutic claims. No regulatory clearance (FDA, Health Canada, etc.).
All BCI references are limited to non-invasive, voluntary, external sensing for research only.

4. Misuse in Military, Surveillance, or Coercive Applications

The architecture is intended strictly for civilian research and open academic collaboration.
Prohibited use includes: weaponization or force-projection systems, military command-and-control infrastructure,
surveillance systems targeting individuals or populations, coercive monitoring or behavioral profiling.
Cryptography, XR physics, and digital twins must not be used to facilitate harm, coercion, or exploitation.

5. Data Privacy and Identity Risks

Incorrect use of PQC identity, XR telemetry, or digital-twin synchronization may expose sensitive information.
To prevent misuse: no user-identifiable data shall be collected without explicit consent;
all identity keys must remain in user control; no behavioral, biometric, or environmental telemetry may be used for profiling;
User privacy and autonomy supersede all technical goals.

6. Manipulation of XR Environments

XR systems can influence perception and behavior.
Because TetraKlein includes XR physics models, misuse may include: creating deceptive XR environments,
altering perceived reality for manipulation, inducing discomfort or sensory overwhelm, unsafe physical interactions due to incorrect timing or physics.
All XR experiments must respect defined XR Safety Envelopes and remain supervised.

7. Cryptographic Misuse or Overclaiming

The architecture is not a final, validated cryptosystem.
Risks include: overstating cryptographic assurances, misusing unfinished implementations,
employing unverified code for secure communication, assuming quantum resistance without proper analysis.
All cryptographic primitives must be treated as experimental.
No confidentiality, integrity, or authenticity guarantees should be assumed.

8. Misuse Through Premature Standardization

TetraKlein must not be: deployed as an identity standard, used as an XR/ledger integration standard,
integrated into governance, civic, or financial systems, used as a protocol in any context requiring public trust.
Only after years of open review, formal verification, and reproducible experimentation should standardization be considered.

9. Intellectual Misuse and Misrepresentation

Third parties must not:falsely claim operational capability, misrepresent the research as a finished product,
market TetraKlein as a commercial or government-ready platform, distort the original intent for ideological, conspiratorial, or speculative narratives.
The architecture is a research roadmap, not a functioning world-scale system.
Summary of Misuse Prevention Principles To prevent harm, TetraKlein must be used only for:
open scientific exploration, theoretical research, academic replication, safe XR and cryptographic prototyping,
mathematics and verification studies.

All other uses—medical, military, surveillance, commercial deployment, unsupervised autonomy—are strictly prohibited.

Responsible Disclosure Policy

Baramay Station Research Inc. — TetraKlein Architecture Program
Version: December 2025

The TetraKlein framework is an ongoing academic and engineering research project.
Although it is not an operational system and does not claim production security, Baramay Station Research Inc. maintains a formal responsible-disclosure pathway to promote safe, transparent, and ethical communication of discovered issues.

This policy applies to all research artifacts released under the TetraKlein program, including mathematical specifications, AIR constraint sets, prototype code, XR physics kernels, digital-twin convergence models, and ledger-verification components.

## Responsible Disclosure Policy

The TetraKlein framework is an ongoing research initiative in cryptography, verifiable computation, XR physics modeling, ledger design, and multidomain simulation. Although no component is production-ready, Baramay Station Research Inc. maintains a responsible disclosure process to encourage safe, ethical reporting of security-relevant findings.

### Reporting Vulnerabilities
If you discover a potential vulnerability, weakness, or inconsistency in:
- the cryptographic constructions,
- AIR constraints or zero-knowledge systems,
- XR/DTC safety boundaries,
- ledger or routing components,
- or any reference implementation code,

please report it privately and responsibly.

### How to Submit a Report
Send a detailed description of the issue to:

michael@baramaystationresearchinc.ca

- report issues in good faith,  
- follow the private disclosure process,  
- avoid exploiting or publicly sharing vulnerabilities prior to resolution.

### Prohibited Activities
Do **not**:
- test attacks against production networks,  
- target unrelated infrastructure,  
- perform denial-of-service attempts,  
- exploit hypothetical vulnerabilities outside controlled research settings.

### Closing Statement
TetraKlein depends on transparent, collaborative, and ethical review. Responsible disclosure strengthens the entire research ecosystem and ensures future versions of the architecture evolve with rigor and safety.
