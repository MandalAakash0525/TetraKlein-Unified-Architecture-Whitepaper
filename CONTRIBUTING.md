## Mission

TetraKlein aims to advance:

- open, verifiable computation  
- transparent scientific methodology  
- reproducible XR and digital-twin research  
- post-quantum cryptography  
- zero-knowledge trust frameworks  
- decentralized, identity-bound networks  

This project is released to help researchers, developers, and institutions build provable, reliable, and safe computational systems for the coming decades.

# Contributing to TetraKlein  
**Baramay Station Research Inc. — Canadian Non-Profit R&D**

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the **TetraKlein Unified Architecture**.  
This repository contains post-quantum cryptography, XR physics kernels, zero-knowledge AIR systems, digital-twin mathematics, and hypercube-ledger research.  
Contributions should follow rigorous scientific and engineering practices.

Please read the following guidelines before submitting any issues or pull requests.

---

## 1. Code of Conduct

All contributors must follow the repository’s **Code of Conduct** (see `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`).  
We require a professional, respectful, and research-focused environment.

---

## 2. Types of Accepted Contributions

### **A. Documentation Contributions**
- Corrections or clarifications in the TetraKlein monograph (PDF)
- Improvements to AIR tables, mathematical descriptions, or diagrams
- Fixes for typos, formatting errors, or incorrect citations
- Enhancements to README, examples, or tutorials

### **B. Technical & Research Contributions**
- Improvements to AIR constraints (TK–U through TK–Z)
- TK–VM opcode semantics, gas-degree corrections, edge-case fixes
- XR physics kernel improvements or validation tests
- DTC convergence operators, projection rules, or multi-agent coupling math

## 3. Contribution Workflow

### **1. Open an Issue First**
Before submitting a pull request, open an issue describing:

- the problem,
- why it matters,
- the proposed solution.

For complex areas (AIR, XR physics, DTC math, ledger spectral operators), include:

- references to the exact PDF sections, page numbers, columns, or AIR-block IDs.

### **2. Pull Requests**
PRs should:

- clearly describe the purpose and scope,
- be limited to a logically contained change,
- include technical justification,
- reference related issues.

Large PRs without discussion will be paused pending review.

### **3. Mathematical or Cryptographic Contributions**
If your contribution affects:

- correctness of AIR constraints
- post-quantum cryptographic assumptions
- spectral operators
- hypercube adjacency rules
- TK–VM verifier semantics
- DTC convergence guarantees

You must include **proof sketches**, reasoning, or references.

### **4. Testing Requirements**
When submitting executable code:

- include unit tests and reproducibility notes,
- include benchmarks if performance-critical,
- provide example inputs/outputs,
- ensure deterministic execution.

### **5. Style & Structure**
- Follow existing directory layout (`/docs`, `/src`, `/ref`, etc.).
- Use Markdown for documentation.
- Use plain LaTeX syntax in `.tex` files, no proprietary extensions.
- For code, prefer:
  - Rust
  - Python
  - OCaml
  - C/C++ (only where performance demands)

---

## 4. Academic Standards

This project maintains academic-quality correctness.  
Contributors should:

- use precise mathematical language,
- cite authoritative sources (NIST, ISO, IEEE, IETF, academic papers),
- avoid speculative or unverifiable claims,
- document assumptions and limitations.

All math-heavy contributions require:

- symbol definitions,
- constraints on domains,
- boundary conditions,
- cross-layer interaction notes (XR ↔ DTC ↔ Ledger).

---

## 5. Security Considerations

### **Do not submit:**
- undisclosed vulnerabilities without responsible-disclosure process,
- cryptographic primitives without clear proofs or references,
- unverifiable claims about PQC resistance, AI safety, or XR safety.

If you believe you found a security issue:

**Email private disclosure**  
michael@baramaystationresearchinc.ca

## 6. Intellectual Property

By contributing, you agree your contributions will be released under:

- **MIT License** (software)
- **Apache 2.0** (software)
- **CC-BY-4.0** (scientific/technical content)

No proprietary restrictions may be added.

---

## 7. Inclusion of the Original 2025 Manuscript

Contributions **must not** alter or rewrite the archival historical paper:


Only **metadata**, **context notes**, or **errata references** may be added.

This paper is preserved “as-is” for historical continuity.
